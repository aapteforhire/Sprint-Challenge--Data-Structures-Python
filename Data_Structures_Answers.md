Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method? 

O(1) because one is inserting at a given index self.current everytime without 
changing  the positiion of existing elements in the list.

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?

O(1)

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

O(n) because one is generating a list of n elements 

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

O(1)

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

O(n^2) as the lengths of the two lists are equal. 

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

O(1)

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
